## Story behind the game

Chota Raju always wanted to do something extraordinary and cool. He always dreamed to be a superhero and loved cycling across the GM Ground where he met Zhulie.

As a kid he built a treehouse to have one of the best summer vacations with his closest friend Zhulie, the coolest and nicest girl he ever met. But since he lived far away from the city, he had lesser amount of resources to fill in the treehouse with cool stuff and impress Zhulie.

Kaliya, who always bullied Chota Raju, told him that he is ready to give him a few supplies if and only if he wins the Khelega Kya? Challenge for him. Khelega Kya? Challenge is a national gaming competition created by four easy going, kickass, mindful engineers who liked to call themselves as ASAP because they thought that it would be cool.

Chota Raju knew that this was his closest chance he could ever get to tell Zhulie about his feelings for her. And he wanted to make sure that it would be perfect. 

WILL YOU HELP CHOTA RAJU GET HIS GIRL?
